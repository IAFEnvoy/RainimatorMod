`Fabric API`(**Required**): Common toolkits.

`Trinkets`(**Required**): Used for more item slots. (Such as back / belt)

## Features

### Weapons

Add most of the weapons frequently appeared in the videos.
Each of them has a unique effect.

Find out them by yourself! (~~You can also see the code.~~)

### Entity / Boss

Add part of them firstly since the skins are hard to find.

Summon them by using the `Dark Obsidian Block`.
See summon recipes with `EMI`.

### Item Description (Not Work **NOW**)

Some items with `Press [LALT] for more info` in tooltip have an in-game description.
Press Left ALT button when hover it to open.
